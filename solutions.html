            <h2 class="h2section">What is Rising Temperatures? </h2>

            <p> Given the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earths average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880 to 1900) might seem small, but it means a significant increase in accumulated heat.
            </p>

            <p>  That extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals expanding some and shrinking others.  As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.</p>

            <h2 class="h2section">What is CO2 Emissions? </h2>

            <p> 
                Carbon dioxide is a gas consisting of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. Carbon dioxide occurs naturally through volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and human respiration. Its also generated by human-made activities such as burning fossil fuels for power and transportation.
            </p>

            <p> 
                The greenhouse effect is where greenhouses gases, such as CO2, absorb the suns solar energy and traps heat within the Earths atmosphere, creating a climate habitable for humans and other species.

During the day, the sun sends solar energy to the earth, warming up our oceans and land. At night, the Earth releases this energy back into the air to escape through the Earths atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap some of this escaping heat, keeping our plant at a temperature perfect for living in.

            <h2 class="h2section">What is Rising Sea Levels? </h2>

            <p>
                Global mean sea level has risen about 8 to 9 inches (21 to 24 centimeters) since 1880, with about a third of that coming in just the last two and a half decades. The rising water level is mostly due to a combination of melt water from glaciers and ice sheets and thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. In 2020, global mean sea level was 91.3 millimeters (3.6 inches) above the 1993 average, making it the highest annual average in the satellite record (1993-present).
            </p>

            <p> 
                In urban settings along coastlines around the world, rising seas threaten infrastructure necessary for local jobs and regional industries. Roads, bridges, subways, water supplies, oil and gas wells, power plants, sewage treatment plants, landfills the list is practically endless are all at risk from sea level rise. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                Higher background water levels mean that deadly and destructive storm surges, such as those associated with Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and Hurricane Michael push farther inland than they once did. Higher sea level also means more frequent high tide flooding, sometimes called nuisance flooding because it isnt generally deadly or dangerous, but it can be disruptive and expensive.

            <h2 class="h2section">What is Water Usage? </h2>

            <p> 
                The average American family uses more than 300 gallons of water at home daily, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). If that seems like a really high number lets first consider how water is used in our everyday lives.
            </p> 

            <p> 
                The Earth might have many bodies of water, but the fact is that less than 1% of the water on earth is fit for all of the uses listed above. The remaining 99% is found in oceans (which is saltwater and not suitable for our uses), frozen in the polar ice caps, or too difficult to reach for practical use by cities or communities.
            </p>

            <p>
                Failing to conserve water can eventually lead to a lack of an adequate, healthy water supply, which can have drastic consequences in rising costs, reduced food supplies, health hazards, and political conflict.

            <p> Sustainability involves taking action now to enable a future where the environment and living conditions are protected and enhanced. In implementing sustainability practices, NASA manages risks to missions, risks to the environment, and risks to our communities, all optimized within existing resources.</p>
