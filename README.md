# Our Mission 

Global warming and climate change are one of the major challenges of our time. It can result in many serious and continuing problems to the environment, and can even impact human health. Frequently global warming can cause droughts, storms, heatwaves, rising sea levels, melting of glaciers, warming oceans, and more. 'The climate has continued to respond to the resulting warming from these increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, which also experienced record increases in 2020 (Blunden, J. and T. Boyer, 24).' All of these issues have serious consequences for animals, humans, environmental changes, and communities. Climate change has drastically increased over the years and its only a matter of time before we reduce or stop the long-term effects. 'The year 2020 was one of the three warmest since records began in the mid-to-late 1800s, with global surface temperatures around 0.6 degree C above the 1981 to 2010 average, despite the El Nino: Southern Oscillation progressing from neutral to La Nina conditions by August (Blunden, J. and T. Boyer, 24).'

Since climate change can lead to more flooding, drought, and heat, the rising temperatures and changing climate could put out water supply at risk. Our water supply is vulnerable to drought. 'The 2030 Water Resources Group (2009) concluded that the world would face a 40% global water deficit by 2030 under a business as usual scenario(UN Water, 2020).' With the rising temperatures increasing evaporation makes the droughts overall worse. When overuse of water in drought-prone areas the groundwater is exhausted. Not only is drought the main concern, so are the water temperatures. The ongoing change in climate can influence water temperature increase. This increase can cause the growth of toxic algae, and water disruptions will be affected. These extreme weather events and conditions can make it more difficult to access safe drinking water, especially for children.


# Why Visualizations? 

When they say a 'picture is worth a thousand words' they really do mean that.  For data visualization you need to know the context, the source of the data, how and why they were collected, whether more could be collected, the reasons for drawing the displays, and how people with the necessary background knowledge advise they might be interpreted.The potential synergy of text and graphics can be appreciated by talking through your own graphics, explaining them to others. Why have you drawn those graphics? How have you drawn them? What can be seen? Are there interesting patterns? What could be changed and improved? Which other graphics might be drawn? How can conclusions be checked? There should be more talking about graphics and less relying on the graphics to speak for themselves.

Graphics reveal data features that statistics and models may miss: unusual distributions of data, local patterns, clusterings, gaps, missing values, evidence of rounding or heaping, implicit boundaries, outliers, and so on. Graphics raise questions that stimulate research and suggest ideas. 

# What we Learned

  ### D3.js 

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

  ### Design Princples 

When building a wesbite its really important to note design princples. There are a lot of basics out there when designing. 

Definition: Product design principles (or, in short, design principles) are value statements that describe the most important goals that a product or service should deliver for users and are used to frame design decisions.

Some princples that were used when designing this website: 
  
        - Hierarchy
        - Contrast 
        - Repetition 
        - Color
        - Avoid clutter
