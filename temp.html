               <p> 
                Worldwide, 2016 was the warmest year on record, 2020 was the second warmest, and 2011 to 2020 was the warmest decade on record since thermometer based observations began. Global average surface temperature has risen at an average rate of 0.17 F per decade since 1901, similar to the rate of warming within the contiguous 48 states. Since the late 1970s, however, the United States has warmed faster than the global rate.
            </p>

        <p> Temperature is a fundamental measurement for describing the climate, and the temperature in particular places can have wide ranging effects on human life and ecosystems. For example, increases in air temperature can lead to more intense heat waves, which can cause illness and death, especially in vulnerable populations. Annual and seasonal temperature patterns also determine the types of animals and plants that can survive in particular locations. Changes in temperature can disrupt a wide range of natural processes, particularly if these changes occur more quickly than plant and animal species can adapt.

            <p>
                The graph above shows the average temperature per year from 1922-2021. The mean temperature was 52 degrees and stayed around that point up until the mid 1950's when production started to skyrocket. The average temperature per year continues to increase and will continue unless significant changes are made.
