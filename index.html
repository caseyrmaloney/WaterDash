        <h2 class="h2section"> What is our Mission? </h2>


        <p>
            Global warming and climate change are one of the major challenges of our time. It can result in many serious
            and continuing problems to the environment, and can even impact human health. Frequently global warming can
            cause droughts, storms, heatwaves, rising sea levels, melting of glaciers, warming oceans, and more. 'The
            climate has continued to respond to the resulting warming from these increases in CO2 and other greenhouse
            gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, which also experienced record increases in 2020 (Blunden, J. and T.
            Boyer, 24).' All of these issues have serious consequences for animals, humans, environmental changes, and
            communities. Climate change has drastically increased over the years and its only a matter of time before
            we reduce or stop the long-term effects. 'The year 2020 was one of the three warmest since records began in
            the mid-to-late 1800s, with global surface temperatures around 0.6 degree C above the 1981 to 2010 average, despite
            the El Nino: Southern Oscillation progressing from neutral to La Nina conditions by August (Blunden, J. and
            T. Boyer, 24).'
        </p>

        <p>
            Since climate change can lead to more flooding, drought, and heat, the rising temperatures and changing
            climate could put out water supply at risk. Our water supply is vulnerable to drought. 'The 2030 Water
            Resources Group (2009) concluded that the world would face a 40% global water deficit by 2030 under a
            business as usual scenario(UN Water, 2020).' With the rising temperatures increasing evaporation makes the
            droughts overall worse. When overuse of water in drought-prone areas the groundwater is exhausted. Not only
            is drought the main concern, so are the water temperatures. The ongoing change in climate can influence
            water temperature increase. This increase can cause the growth of toxic algae, and water disruptions will be
            affected. These extreme weather events and conditions can make it more difficult to access safe drinking
            water, especially for children.
